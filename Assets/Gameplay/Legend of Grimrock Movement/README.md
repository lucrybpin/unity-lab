## 🎮 About the Project

This is a simple movement prototype made with Unity, inspired by the game *Legend of Grimrock*. The player moves using keyboard input, with forward/backward movement and left/right rotation.

---

## 📍 Concept

The player uses the **W/S** keys to move forward and backward.

The **A/D** keys rotate the character left and right.

No collision or wall detection is implemented.
